[Gooey.AI](http://gooey.ai/) is the low-code orchestration platform with **discoverable workflows** & **unified billing to all of GenAI universe.**

# 🤖🍲 What is Gooey Server?

Gooey.AI is a low-code AI recipe platform and Gooey Server is our core repo.  
It allows users to discover, customize, and deploy AI "recipes" using the best of private and open-source AI,
all using a single API with a single auth token.  
Recipes are workflows that incorporate various models to accomplish a task; they are designed to be highly customizable and shareable.

## 🧑‍💻 Who is this for and why would I want to use it?

For most developers, we DO NOT recommend running or forking Gooey Server; use our [APIs](https://gooey.ai/api/) or [client SDK](https://github.com/GooeyAI/python-sdk) instead.  
The repo is intended only for developers who want to run and deploy their own server cluster or run Gooey locally for development purposes.

Specifically, this repo may be for you if:

- You want to create a new recipe (instead of changing the parameters on an existing one)
- You want to add an AI model that we currently don’t support.
- You are an enterprise with specific requirements regarding data practices, such as using specific cloud providers.
- You want to add some other functionality that we don’t support.

## 📋 Setup

### ☁️ Create a google cloud / firebase account

1. Create a [google cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/) project
2. Create a [firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) (using the same google cloud project)
3. Enable the following services:
   - [Firestore](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore)
   - [Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication)
   - [Storage](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/storage)
   - [Speech-to-Text](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/speech.googleapis.com)
   - [Text-to-Speech](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/texttospeech.googleapis.com)
   - [Translation API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/translate.googleapis.com)
   - [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)
4. Go to IAM, Create a service account with following roles:
   - Cloud Datastore User
   - Cloud Speech Administrator
   - Cloud Translation API Admin
   - Firebase Authentication Admin
   - Storage Admin
5. Create and Download a JSON Key for this service account and save it to the project root as `serviceAccountKey.json`.
6. Add your project & bucket name to `.env`

### 💻 Setup (Mac)

- Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) & install the same python version as in our [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- Clone the github repo to `gooey-server` (and make sure that's the folder name)
- Create & activate a virtualenv (e.g. `poetry shell`)
- Run `poetry install --with dev`
- Install [redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-mac-os/), [rabbitmq](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-homebrew.html), and [postgresql](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/postgresql@15) (e.g. `brew install redis rabbitmq postgresql@15`)
- Enable background services for `redis`, `rabbitmq`, and `postgresql` (e.g. with `brew services start redis` and similar for `rabbitmq` and `postgresql`)
- Use `sqlcreate` helper to create a user and database for gooey:
  - `./manage.py sqlcreate | psql postgres`
  - make sure you are able to access the database with `psql -W -U gooey gooey` (and when prompted for password, entering `gooey`)
- Create an `.env` file from `.env.example` (Read [12factor.net/config](https://12factor.net/config))
- Run `./manage.py migrate`
- Install the zbar library (`brew install zbar`)
- (optional) Install imagemagick - Needed for HEIC image support - https://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.5.7/guide/install.html

```
brew install freetype imagemagick
export MAGICK_HOME=/opt/homebrew
```

### 🐧 Setup (Linux)

- Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) & install the same python version as in our [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (currently Python 3.10)
  - `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
  - This is likely available in your distro's package repos.
- Clone this repository:
- Create and activate a virtualenv using `poetry shell`
- Install dependencies using `poetry install --with dev`
  - Note: you may have to remove `package-mode=false` on line 7 of `pyproject.toml`
- Install redis, rabbitmq-server, and postgresql 15 using your distro's package manager.
- Enable these services as background services using `sudo systemctl enable --now redis rabbitmq-server postgresql`
- Configure Postgres to ensure that password authentication is enabled for the gooey user
  - open the pg_hba.conf file in a text editor. On Linux, by default, it is usually located either at `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/` or `/var/lib/pgsql/<version>/data/`
  - add/edit the file so that there are lines at the bottom that looks like this:
  ```
  local    all        gooey                    md5
  host     all        gooey                    md5
  ```
  - restart postgresql using `sudo systemctl restart postgresql`
- Use the manage.py script to set up the Postgres database:
  - To create the user and database for gooey: `./manage.py sqlcreate | sudo -u postgres psql postgres `
  - Test your setup to ensure that `gooey-server` can access the database by running `psql -W -U gooey gooey` and supplying "gooey" as the password
- Create a .env file from `.env.example`
- Install the zbar library using your distro's package manager.

### 🌍 Frontend

Clone [gooey-gui](https://github.com/GooeyAI/gooey-gui) repo, in the same directory as `gooey-server` and follow the setup steps.

### 🧪 Run Tests

```
ulimit -n unlimited  # Increase the number of open files allowed
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### 🗄 Initialize databse

```bash
# reset the database
./manage.py reset_db -c
# create the database
./manage.py sqlcreate | psql postgres
# run migrations
./manage.py migrate
# load the fixture (donwloaded by ./scripts/run-tests.sh)
./manage.py loaddata fixture.json
# create a superuser to access admin
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 🏃 Run

_Note: The `gooey-server` project is not currently set up to be run without support from Gooey. This software requires access to a Google Cloud instance as well as business data loaded in the database. If you are interested in running this software totally independently, reach out to support@gooey.ai to communicate with our enterprise team._

### Services

These are the services that you need to run to start developing locally. Open them in separate terminals so you can debug them individually.

| Service                 | Port   | Command                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python API + GUI Server | `8080` | `poetry run uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload`                                                                     |
| Node Frontend           | `3000` | `cd ../gooey-gui/; PORT=3000 REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 npm run build && npm run start`                                             |
| Celery (Task Runner)    | -      | `poetry run celery -A celeryapp worker -P threads -c 16 -l DEBUG`                                                                         |
| Django Admin site       | `8000` | `poetry run python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000`                                                                                    |
| Vespa (Vector DB)       | `8085` | `docker run --hostname vespa-container -p 8085:8080 -p 19071:19071 --volume vespa:/opt/vespa/var -it --rm --name vespa vespaengine/vespa` |

This default startup assumes that Redis, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL are installed and running
as background services on ports `6379`, `5672`, and `5432` respectively.

The gooey-gui repo should be cloned at `../gooey-gui/`
(adjacent to where the`gooey-server` repo sits).

### Reloading on code changes

- The Python API + GUI Server should reload the entire server on code changes. You can refresh the page to see the changes.

- The Celery worker must be manually restarted on code changes.

- If you are working on the gooey-gui (react frontend), you can run:

```shell
cd ../gooey-gui/; PORT=3000 REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 npm run dev
```

#### Hot Reloading

If you run this command, the Python API + GUI Server will reload the webpage in-place on code changes.

```shell
poetry run python server.py
```

This mostly works, but consumes more memory and usually OOMs after a few reloads; YMMV. Use it to iterate quickly on UI changes!

### Vespa (used for vector search)

You need to install OrbStack or Docker Desktop for this to work.

1. Create a persistent volume for Vespa:

```bash
docker volume create vespa
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run \
  --hostname vespa-container \
  -p 8085:8080 -p 19071:19071 \
  --volume vespa:/opt/vespa/var \
  -it --rm --name vespa vespaengine/vespa
```

3. Run the setup script

```bash
./manage.py runscript setup_vespa_db
```

### Honcho

> [!CAUTION]
> This method is not recommended as this makes it harder to debug individual services but it is the easiest way to start all services at once.

You can start all required processes in one command with Honcho:

```shell
poetry run honcho start
```

The processes that it starts are defined in [`Procfile`](Procfile). You can open the Procfile and comment out any services you don't need to run.

This will spin up the API server at `http://localhost:8080`. To view the autogenerated API documentation, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/docs`

## 💣 Secret Scanning

Gitleaks will automatically run pre-commit (see `pre-commit-config.yaml` for details) to prevent commits with secrets in the first place. To test this without committing, run `pre-commit` from the terminal. To skip this check, use `SKIP=gitleaks git commit -m "message"` to commit changes. Preferably, label false positives with the `#gitleaks:allow` comment instead of skipping the check.

Gitleaks will also run in the CI pipeline as a GitHub action on push and pull request (can also be manually triggered in the actions tab on GitHub). To update the baseline of ignored secrets, run `python ./scripts/create_gitleaks_baseline.py` from the venv and commit the changes to `.gitleaksignore`.

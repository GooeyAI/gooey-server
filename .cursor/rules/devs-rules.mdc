Make sure you always format code in reverse topological order, i.e. put the main() function at the top and the dependencies of the function below it.

E.g.

```python
def main():
    dependency1()

def dependency1():
    dependency2()
    dependency3()

def dependency2():
    dependency3()

def dependency3():
    pass
```
